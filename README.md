<br>### Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This repository hosts a Tic-Tac-Toe game developed as an internship task assigned by Skill Craft Technology. The game is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering two modes: **Computer vs Human** and **Human vs Human**. It includes a basic AI using the minimax algorithm for the computer's moves.

 Features:
- **Modes:** Choose between playing against the computer or another human player.
- **Responsive Design:** Playable on both desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Animated UI Elements:** Mario-themed animations add a fun touch to the game experience.

 How to Play:
1. **Computer vs Human Mode:** Play against an AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm to make its moves. Click on cells to place your move.
   
2. **Human vs Human Mode:** Play against another person on the same device. Take turns clicking cells to place 'X' or 'O'.

3. **Restart Game:** At any time, restart the game using the "Restart Game" button to reset the board and start a new game.

Technologies Used:
- **HTML5:** Structure of the game board and user interface.
- **CSS3:** Styling and animations to enhance visual appeal.
